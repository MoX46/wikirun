# wikirun


notes:

* Use wikipedia api to get top ages for random date
* Select two of those top pages for wikipedia speedrun
* Maybe use the top pages url for other projects?

* Frontend design - and delivery
* Must be easy to use and intuitive
* Clean minimal design which hides away when playign the game
* Bright fun colors for the game-like feel
* Retro-gaming vibe?
* Different time controls (chess overlaps?)
* Different variations (more chess????) - points based, time based, other goals?
* Most obscure path (path with lest visited pages), most common path (path with popular pages)
* Embed wikipedia into webpage cleanly and track the browser history/clicks?
* Play modes (MRPG, 1v1 random, 1v1 a friend, etc)
* Implement a elo rating system? this would be fun


### MVP
* Pick random pages and display
* Integrate wikipedia into page
* Track both time and page history (url)
* Detect winning conditons
* Display start, stop, pause, win, lose conditions
* Play agains a friend (needs a game specific url)
